There are usually between 1–2 readings associated with each class.

The students will be asked to read draft chapters of the following book:

\[de Weck\] = de Weck, O., and J. Lyneis. _Successfully Designing and Managing Complex Projects_. 1st ed. MIT Press, 2014 (in preparation).

This textbook is being written to support this class and is currently under development. The book will be part of the new Engineering Systems book series published by MIT Press.
